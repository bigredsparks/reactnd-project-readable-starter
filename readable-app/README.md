# Readable - An application for posting messages and comments
Author: Vince Sparks
Date: 4/15/2018

Notes:
- The main focus of this project is to use Redux to manage application state in the Redux store.  Some components may maintain separate state where that state is isolated to the compoent.
- The application is built using components from mbreact.  These were selected based on recommedations from the review of project #1
- The application uses reactive and fluid components but was not designed to degrade gracefully at smaller screen sizes.  As such, the application should be view with a full screen for best results.

To install and run:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
